# research-day_css-framework_responsive-website
I developed this website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap in Visual Studio Code. This website represents a martial arts academy where individuals can learn and join a community of passionate practitioners. The reason I chose this idea is that I am a fan of martial arts, and I actively train in boxing, kickboxing, and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.
